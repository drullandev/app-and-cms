/**
 * ServiceManager Class
 * 
 * This class manages the initialization and access to core services used within the application. 
 * It ensures that only one instance of each service (such as SentryManager, RestManager, 
 * and PushNotificationManager) is created, providing a centralized way to manage them.
 * 
 * It follows the Singleton pattern to ensure that services are initialized only once and shared 
 * across the application. The class also allows for lazy initialization of the services when needed.
 * 
 * Usage Example:
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * const serviceManager = ServiceManager.getInstance(restManager, serviceConfig);
 * const sentryManager = serviceManager.getSentryManager();
 * const pushManager = serviceManager.getPushNotificationManager();
 * ```
